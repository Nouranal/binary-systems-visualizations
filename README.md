# Binary Star System Visualizations

This project provides interactive visualizations of various types of binary star systems using Python and Plotly. It is organized into separate Jupyter notebooks for clarity and future extensibility.

## Notebooks

- [Visual Binary System](notebooks/visual_binary.ipynb) – Simulates and animates a 3D orbit for binary stars with different mass configurations, and Alpha Centauri AB.
- [Eclipsing Binary System](notebooks/eclipsing_binary.ipynb) – *Coming soon*
- [Spectroscopic Binary System](notebooks/spectroscopic_binary.ipynb) – *Coming soon*

## Requirements

See [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) for needed Python packages.
